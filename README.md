# motorcortex-2dcam
motorcortex-2dcam acts exaclty as a 2d camera that can focus and zoom on
any given point of any element.
You can move your camera around, zoom and unzoom, follow paths, all
via its easy to use Incidents.

[Demo](https://kissmybutton.github.io/motorcortex-2dcam/demo/)

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save @kissmybutton/motorcortex-2dcam
# OR
$ yarn add @kissmybutton/motorcortex-2dcam
```

## Importing and loading

```javascript
import MotorCortex from "@kissmybutton/motorcortex";
import TDCAMDef from "@kissmybutton/motorcortex-2dcam";
const TDCAM = MotorCortex.loadPlugin(TDCAMDef);
```

## API
The Plugin exposes two Incidents:
* ZoomTo
* FollowPath

### ZoomTo
Any element can be selected by ZoomTo Incident and the camera will zoom
on any of its points, on any duration and by any easing. 
Our viewport is always considered the parent of our target element. The
virual camera will zoom to the given point of our target and will bring it in the middle
of our viewport, in the middle of its parent element, zoomed as per attrs passed.

```javascript
import MotorCortex from "@kissmybutton/motorcortex";
import TDCAMDef from "@kissmybutton/motorcortex-2dcam";
const TDCAM = MotorCortex.loadPlugin(TDCAMDef);

const zoomto = new TDCAM.ZoomTo({
    animatedAttrs: {
        position: {
            x: 1280, // pixel 1280
            y: 150, // pixel 150
            zoom: 1.2 // zoom level, from 0 to inf., 1:1 with scale
        }
    }
}, {
    selector: '.img',
    duration: 4000,
    easing: 'easeInOutSine'
});
```

### IMPORTANT
The element that you want to zoom to (any element that you target via your selector) must have `transform-origin: top left`

The expected attributes of ZoomTo include the animatedAttrs. This should contain the animated attribute `position`. 
Position is a composite attribute consisting of x, y and zoom, where x and y are the coordinates of our selected element we want to focus and zoom the zoom level we want to apply.
All, x, y and zoom are optional and if not provided will not be affected during animation.

### FollowPath
Instead of poviding the point we want to focus on and let the camera animate its position
to it we can provide (svg) paths, in the form of path definition ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d])
For this instead of using ZoomTo and providing x, y and zoom to define the target position of the camera,
you can use FollowPath and just provide a path that you want your camera to follow and your final zoom
level. 

```javascript
const fpath = new TDCAM.FollowPath({
    animatedAttrs: {
        position: {
            path: 'M 1280 150 L 1380 464',
            zoom: 1.2
        }
    },
    from: 0.2,
    to: 0.9,
    transition: 1000
}, {
    duration: 3000,
    selector: '.img',
    easing: 'easeOutCubic'
});
```

As you can see on the example, on our animatedAttrs we again used the position attribute but this
time we passed instead of x and y the `path` which we want our camera to follow.

If you want your camera to move only on a part of a path you can use the `from` and `to` attributes
that define the fraction (0 to 1) that you want your start and end point to be. E.g. if you
provide the values `from: 0.2` and `to: 0.9` then the camera will start from the 20% of the path's overall length and
will animate all the way to the 90% of its length. Of course both start and end are optional and have
default values 0 and 1 respectively. 

As we are moving our camera along a path, on the 0 millisecond of our Incident our camera will be placed on
the very first point of the provided path. This can cause a "jump" effect as the camera will 
move to point 0 without animation. In order to handle this the `transition` attribute
is provided. If provided, transition defines (in milliseconds) an optional transition time from the current
camera position to point 0 of our path, so we avoid the jump. If provided then the camera will lineary move from
the carent camera position to the point 0 position in the given milliseconds. The total duration of the
Incident will not be affected as the movement on the actual path will be
less by "transition" milliseconds. "transition" of course is optional with default value = 0.
